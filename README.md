# Noise-Rust

Implementation of the [Noise Protocol
Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org) in Rust.

Uses [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto) but has pluggable
support for other crypto libraries.

Based on trevp's [screech](https://github.com/trevp/screech).

## Status

Mostly complete. Play with it!

Perhaps don't use for security critical purposes (yet)!
