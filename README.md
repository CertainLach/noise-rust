# Noise-Rust

Implementation of the [Noise Protocol
Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org) in Rust. A continuation of
trevp's [screech](https://github.com/trevp/screech).

## Status

All basic patterns are implemented. Vectors from noise-c and cacophony
are passed.

Please test and review.

The API is not considered stable yet, and may still change
non-trivially.

And perhaps don't use for security critical purposes (yet)!
